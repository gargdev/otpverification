## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Download and install Node.js.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - npm is bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-react-project.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-react-project
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Explain how to run your React.js application locally for development or testing purposes.

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the development server, and your application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Development

If you want to provide information on how to contribute to your project or if you have guidelines for contributors, this is the place to include it.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following npm scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm build`: Builds the production-ready application.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner.
- `npm eject`: Ejects the app from Create React App, allowing you to customize the configuration.

Refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) for more details on available scripts.

### Contributing
